# Vector_bt

A Practical Guide to Backtesting and Optimizing Trading Strategies with Vectorbt.

We’ll explore how to optimize the MACD trading strategy using python-based Vectorbt package.

We’ll also evaluate the Sharpe ratio of the MACD strategy using walk forward validation and compare it to a simple buy-and-hold approach.

This study provides a robust framework for assessing hyperparameters, optimizing and evaluating the performance of similar strategies.

For best visualisation, use VSCode.
